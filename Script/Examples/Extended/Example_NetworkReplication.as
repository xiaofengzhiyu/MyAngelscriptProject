/**
 * Network replication and RPC example.
 *
 * AngelScript supports standard UE replication features:
 *
 *   Property replication:
 *     - Replicated              — property is replicated to all clients
 *     - ReplicatedUsing=FuncName — property is replicated with a RepNotify callback
 *     - ReplicationCondition=X  — fine-grained replication condition (OwnerOnly, SkipReplay, etc.)
 *
 *   RPC (Remote Procedure Call) declarations:
 *     - Server                  — called on the client, executes on the server
 *     - Client                  — called on the server, executes on the owning client
 *     - NetMulticast            — called on the server, executes on server and all clients
 *     - WithValidation          — requires a _Validate() function that returns bool
 *     - Unreliable              — sent unreliably (may be dropped); default is Reliable
 *
 *   Specifier names: use Server/Client/NetMulticast (NOT NetServer/NetClient).

/**
 * Demonstrates all RPC patterns available in AngelScript.
 *
 * Key rules:
 *   - The actor must have bReplicates = true.
 *   - Server RPCs execute on the server when called from any client.
 *   - Client RPCs execute on the owning client when called from the server.
 *   - NetMulticast RPCs execute on the server and all connected clients.
 *   - WithValidation requires a sibling _Validate() function.
 *   - By default RPCs are Reliable; add Unreliable for non-critical calls.
