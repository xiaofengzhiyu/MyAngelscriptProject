# angelscript-test-unity-build-symbol-hygiene Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change fix-angelscript-test-unity-symbol-scope. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Test helper namespace imports stay local
Angelscript C++ automation test `.cpp` files SHALL NOT use file-level `using namespace` declarations for test helper/support namespaces. Test helper/support namespaces include namespaces whose purpose is scoped to test implementation, such as names ending in `_Private`, names ending in `TestHelpers`, `AngelscriptNativeTestSupport`, `AngelscriptSDKTestSupport`, and related AngelScriptSDK helper namespaces.

#### Scenario: Helper namespace used by one test method
- **WHEN** a test method needs several helpers from a test helper/support namespace
- **THEN** the `using namespace` declaration is placed inside that method body or the helper names are explicitly qualified

#### Scenario: Helper namespace used by class setup or teardown
- **WHEN** `BEFORE_ALL`, `BEFORE_EACH`, `AFTER_EACH`, or `AFTER_ALL` needs helpers from a test helper/support namespace
- **THEN** the import is local to that hook body or the helper names are explicitly qualified

#### Scenario: AngelScriptSDK support namespace used by CQTest
- **WHEN** an AngelScriptSDK CQTest uses helpers from `AngelscriptNativeTestSupport` or `AngelscriptSDKTestSupport`
- **THEN** the namespace import is placed inside each CQTest method or hook that needs it, or the helper names are explicitly qualified

### Requirement: File-private helper namespaces are explicitly qualified
Angelscript C++ automation test `.cpp` files SHALL NOT use `using namespace` directives for namespaces ending in `_Private` at any scope. The `_Private` namespace definitions MAY remain as the file-local helper ownership boundary.

#### Scenario: Private helper used by one CQTest method
- **WHEN** a CQTest method needs a helper from a namespace ending in `_Private`
- **THEN** the helper is referenced with explicit namespace qualification

#### Scenario: Private helper used by non-CQTest automation code
- **WHEN** an `IMPLEMENT_SIMPLE_AUTOMATION_TEST` body, helper function, or lambda needs a helper from a namespace ending in `_Private`
- **THEN** the helper is referenced with explicit namespace qualification

### Requirement: CQTest-owned helpers live inside the CQTest class
Angelscript C++ automation test `.cpp` files SHALL NOT define file-level namespaces ending in `_Private` when those helpers are used by a single `TEST_CLASS_WITH_FLAGS` class. Those helpers MUST be declared inside the owning CQTest class under `private:` as static functions, constants, nested structs, or ordinary fixture state as appropriate.

#### Scenario: Helper used only by one CQTest class
- **WHEN** a helper constant, nested struct, or function is used only by one `TEST_CLASS_WITH_FLAGS` class
- **THEN** the helper is moved into that class body and is not kept in a file-level `_Private` namespace

#### Scenario: CQTest methods still need registration visibility
- **WHEN** private helpers are inserted before CQTest hooks or `TEST_METHOD` declarations
- **THEN** the class restores `public:` before `BEFORE_ALL`, `BEFORE_EACH`, `AFTER_EACH`, `AFTER_ALL`, or `TEST_METHOD` declarations so CQTest registration remains valid

#### Scenario: Helper is shared by several CQTest classes
- **WHEN** a helper is intentionally shared by multiple `TEST_CLASS_WITH_FLAGS` classes in the same `.cpp`
- **THEN** the helper is moved to a shared base/helper type or the remaining file-level helper is explicitly reviewed instead of being imported with `using namespace`

### Requirement: Unity build hazards are fixed at source
Angelscript C++ automation tests SHALL remain compatible with Unreal unity build by avoiding helper-symbol patterns that leak across generated unity translation units.

#### Scenario: Two unity-included tests define same anonymous helper name
- **WHEN** two test `.cpp` files in the same generated unity chunk define a generic helper name in anonymous namespace
- **THEN** at least one helper is renamed to a file-specific name or moved to a named namespace with non-leaking use sites

#### Scenario: A generic file-scope name causes `/w4459`
- **WHEN** a test local or file-scope symbol with a generic name hides a wider symbol in a unity translation unit
- **THEN** the test symbol is renamed to a context-specific name or scoped more narrowly

### Requirement: Broad utility namespace imports are handled separately
The first-pass refactor SHALL focus on test helper/support namespaces that are known to affect unity build lookup and SHALL NOT require removing broad functional utility namespace imports such as `AngelscriptFunctionalTestUtils` unless they cause a concrete unity conflict.

#### Scenario: Shared utility namespace import appears at file scope
- **WHEN** a test `.cpp` imports a shared utility namespace used across many tests
- **THEN** the import may remain until a separate shared-utility cleanup task or a concrete collision requires changing it
