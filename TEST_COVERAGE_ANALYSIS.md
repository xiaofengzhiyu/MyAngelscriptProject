## Coverage Gaps Analysis

### No Significant Gaps Identified

All major systems have:
- Dedicated test files OR
- Comprehensive integration test coverage

### Minimal Areas (By Design)

1. **AngelscriptLoader** - Only 1 .cpp file
   - Minimal module by design
   - Acts as bootstrapper only
   - Integration tested via dependent modules
   - Risk: LOW

2. **AngelscriptUHTTool** - C# project
   - Separate .NET build system
   - Not analyzed in C++ scope
   - Risk: MEDIUM (critical for build pipeline)

### Zero Functional Coverage Gaps

All plugin subsystems have test coverage appropriate to their role.

## Test Execution Infrastructure

### Available Test Entry Points
```powershell
# Run by prefix
RunTests.ps1 -TestPrefix "Angelscript.TestModule.Bindings."

# Run by group
RunTests.ps1 -Group AngelscriptSmoke

# Run by named suite
RunTestSuite.ps1 -Suite Smoke
```

### Test Naming Convention
- Integration tests: `Angelscript.TestModule.<Theme>.*`
- Runtime C++ tests: `Angelscript.CppTests.*`
- Editor tests: `Angelscript.Editor.*`

### Test Organization Benefits
- Themed directories enable targeted regression testing
- Clear responsibility boundaries
- Easy to add new tests in logical categories
- Integration test discovery by prefix

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Maintain Current Coverage
- Continue thematic test organization
- All new features follow existing test patterns
- Use test group taxonomy for regression prevention

### Priority 2: Documentation
- Maintain test naming conventions doc
- Document test execution entry points
- Keep test catalog up to date

### Priority 3: Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Consider UHTTool .NET test analysis
- Document cross-module validation
- Expand headless test support beyond current limitations

---
